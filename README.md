How does it actually work?
The algorithm basically does three things:
Counts how many times you hit a key in a row (like "222" = 3 taps)
Matches that to letters, old-school phone style
Handles mistakes smoothly (just ignores stuff it doesn’t get)

FYI:
'7' is special 'cause it’s got 4 letters (PQRS)
Backspace (*) can undo even after a bunch of taps
Spaces are like "mandatory pauses" between same letters
